vs-code use emmet

// React.createElement returns me javascript object
    - it takes three arguments first tag name, second attributes and third children , if there is multiple child elements passed it in array
// root.render() method converts js object to h1 element of html and render on the browser
// you can use react library just small portion of the html, its only work on that element which is mark as root element by ReactDOM.createRoot(<root element>). Thats why it is library we cant call it as framework
// anything inside the root tag will be replaced by the root.render() method and anything outside the root will be load on browser as it is.
